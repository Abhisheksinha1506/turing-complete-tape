# 🚂 Turing-Complete Tape (Rule 110)

> "A simple row of blocks that, given enough time, can calculate anything in the universe."

### 📢 Latest Status
<!-- LATEST_STATUS_START -->
> The universal calculation has advanced to Generation 81. The tape now contains 28 active computational units. Complex structures called 'gliders' are interacting across the tape, processing information in a Turing-complete manner.

### 📖 The Analogy
Rule 110 is like a game of dominoes that can think. You have a single row of black and white squares. Every day, a new row is created based on the one above it. 

What makes Rule 110 world-famous is that it is "Turing Complete." This means that even though the rules are tiny, they are powerful enough to simulate any computer program ever written. It creates "gliders"—patterns that move across the screen like trains, carrying information and interacting with each other to perform calculations.

### 🌱 How it Evolves
The calculation unfolds automatically:
1. **Reading the Tape**: The current state is stored in [tape.txt](tape.txt).
2. **Applying the Rule**: The script calculates the next step in the universal calculation.
3. **Visualizing History**: The result is appended to the [Evolution History](evolution.md).

**No human has tinkered with the tape since the first '1' was placed.**
